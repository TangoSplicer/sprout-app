# Sprout Security & Privacy Policy

## Your Data, Your Rules

Sprout is built on one principle:  
**Your code, data, and apps belong to you â€” and only you.**

We do **not** collect:
- Your source code
- Your app logic
- Your personal data
- Any usage analytics

## On-Device Only

Everything happens **on your phone**:
- Code editing
- Compilation (Rust + WASM)
- AI assistance (on-device LLM)
- App installation

No data ever leaves your device.

## Permissions

Sprout only asks for permissions when you use them:
- **Storage**: To save your projects
- **Camera**: Only if your app uses it
- **Notifications**: Only if your app schedules alerts

You can deny or revoke any permission at any time.

## AI Assistant

The AI runs **entirely on-device** (e.g., TinyLlama).  
No prompts are sent to servers.  
No data is stored.

## Open Source

The entire compiler and app are [open source](https://github.com/sprout-app/mobile).  
You can audit every line.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a security vulnerability, email:  
**security@sprout.garden**

We respond within 48 hours.

Sprout works for you â€” not for ads, not for data.  
Just for creation.
