# 🤝 **Code of Conduct — The Sprout Pledge**

> *“We grow better together.”*

As contributors and maintainers of Sprout, we pledge to make participation **welcoming, safe, and joyful** for everyone — regardless of background, identity, or experience.

## 🌿 Our Pledge

We promise to:
- **Listen first.** Assume good intent. Speak with kindness.
- **Lift others up.** Celebrate small sprouts. No gatekeeping.
- **Respect time and energy.** No guilt, no pressure, no burnout.
- **Keep it human.** No bots, no flamewars, no dehumanizing language.
- **Protect privacy.** What’s shared in Sprout stays with consent.

## 🚫 What’s Not Okay

We do not tolerate:
- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Condescension (“Actually, you should just use React Native…”)
- Taking credit for others’ ideas
- Spamming or self-promotion without context
- Sharing private conversations or code without permission

## 🌱 What to Do If Something Feels Off

1. **Speak up kindly** — tag someone or DM a maintainer.
2. **Report** to: `TBC` (we respond within 48h)
3. We’ll listen, act with care, and protect your privacy.

## 🌼 Why This Matters

Sprout isn’t just code.  
It’s a **garden of trust**.  
And gardens need tending.

We believe that **everyone deserves to create** — without fear, without gatekeepers, without ego.

So let’s grow with **curiosity, humility, and moxie**.
