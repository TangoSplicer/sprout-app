### 💡 2. **The Real Problem We’re Solving**

It’s not that people can’t code.  
It’s that **the tools don’t respect their time, context, or intent**.

Sprout fixes:

| Problem | Sprout’s Answer |
|-------|----------------|
| “I need a tool, but I can’t afford an app” | Build it yourself — free |
| “I don’t have a laptop” | Use your phone — it’s enough |
| “Code is scary” | Speak in logic, not syntax |
| “I just want a simple app” | No bloat. No frameworks. Just what you need |

> Sprout isn’t about coding.  
> It’s about **agency**.

### 💌 Final Thought

You’re not just building an app.

a world where **tools belong to the people who use them**.

And you don’t need to run code to start that.

You just need to **believe it’s possible**.
